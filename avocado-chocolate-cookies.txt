Ingredients:
 - 100 g (3/4 cup) avocado flesh (very ripe, but not brown)
 - 1/2 cup (120mL) coconut sugar (*SEE NOTES)
 - 1 egg (FOR VEGAN VERSION SEE BELOW)
 - 1/2 cup (120mL) dark cocoa powder
 - 50 g dark chocolate chunks (I used 85% cocoa)
 - 1/2 tsp baking soda

Directions:
  1. Preheat oven to 175°C / 350° F.
  2. In a bowl using a hand mixer (or make everything in a food processor), mix together avocado and coconut sugar until smooth. Add in the egg.
  3. Mix in the cocoa powder and baking soda.
  4. Stir in chocolate chunks.
  5. Using two spoons place dollops of cookie dough in a baking sheet with parchment paper. The cookie won't spread as much as usual cookies when baking, so make sure to flatten them out a bit with the back of the spoon.
  6. Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the cookies don't stick as much to the paper as they did before baking.
  7. Cool down. Store in an airtight container in the fridge.
